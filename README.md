# React Router DOM v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`*`) in React Router DOM v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route doesn't correctly handle routes not explicitly defined in the `Routes` component.  The provided solution offers a fix that ensures the catch-all route functions as expected.

## Issue Description

In React Router DOM v6, the catch-all route is intended to handle any URL that doesn't match other defined routes. However, in certain scenarios, it may fail to function correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, such as rendering the wrong component or errors.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of route order and ensuring that the catch-all route is placed last in the `Routes` component. By placing the catch-all route after the other routes, it ensures it is only used if no other route matches the URL.
